- schema/alert.go defines
    - the ESQuery alert rule
    - the ESQuery alert rules are indexed in ES as `esquery_alert`
    - the Alert structure
    - the generated alerts are saved in ES index `argusgo-alerts`


- cmd/main.go
    - the main entry point of the application
    - Here, the rules are loaded from ES and executed against the documents in ES. The
    rules defines which index to query and the query itself.
    - The results of the queries are processed and alerts are generated based on the defined rules.
    - The generated alerts are then saved back to the `argusgo-alerts` index in ES.

- internal/alert/esquery_alert.go
    - contains the logic for executing ESQuery alert rules
    - defines how to run the queries against ES and process the results to generate alerts
- internal/alert/fetch_alert_rules.go
    - contains the logic for fetching alert rules from ES
    - defines how to retrieve the ESQuery alert rules from the `esquery_alert` index in ES
- internal/alert/save_alerts.go

# Other important instructions for LLMs:
 - If you are asked to `build or run the program` do that.
 - If there are any error in the code during build or run, fix them.

# Local Dev Env Set up Instructions for LLMs:
- Deploy an ES docker instance using the following command:
```
docker run -d --name elasticsearch \
  -p 9200:9200 \
  -p 9300:9300 \
  -e "discovery.type=single-node" \
  -e "xpack.security.enabled=false" \
  docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:9.2.3
```

- Deploy an Kibana instance using the following command:
```
docker run -d \
  --name kibana-alerting \
  --link es-alerting:elasticsearch \
  -p 5601:5601 \
  -e "ELASTICSEARCH_HOSTS=http://elasticsearch:9200" \
  docker.elastic.co/kibana/kibana:9.2.3
